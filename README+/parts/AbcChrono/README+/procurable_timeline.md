# AbcChrono &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; Procurable and Dynamic Timeline

IMAGE OF ABC - CHRONO (BADGE !!! )

AbcChrono introduced the common idea of chronology and dates. Here, we will narrow the theme to an applicable and effective case.

### Business days are an exact example of what we want. 

Consider the case when a promise was made for two days. In many cases, it literally will mean setting a HACK in the calendar cell after the next.

But in most (especially banking, including confirmation) the following omissions will apply.

- Weekend
- Holidays
- Technical close of operations
- 
Wha businessdays

SATURDAY?
AFTERNOON for every day
Eve of XMass

NOW LET's project this to dates

What if the case involves more than one LOCATION?

## Implementation

ARRAY

### C#

LINQ is the best solution.
