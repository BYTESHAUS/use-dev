 The "inputs" and "outputs" of software are anchored to the material world, where numbers can be <mark>concrete</mark>** (_numerus numeratus_) **or <mark>denominated</mark>** (_numerus denominatus_).\

Verbal, documented, and **programmatic** communications frequently rely on titles and contexts and omit tags/units. Shall a context wane - values may "roam" between denominators:

- Earth's closest approach to Mars is ca. `33'900'000` _miles_ but it seems credible in _kilometers_ and _nmi_.
- A child's age of `7` can imply months and years.
- The weekly payment of `1'000` dollars has a national hue: Australian, Canadian, Jamaican, and twenty more.
- _`Jack`_ can be family, given (not only at birth), and a branded name.
- Five stars can mean a constellation and an estimation.

Concurrent measurement systems can make matters even worse, e.g., flight height can be communicated in <i>feet</i> while cockpit variometers will show <i>meters</i>.

Not _denominated_ numbers in applications may imply a single system of categorization (e.g. **SI** for physical values) and ... open wide the gate to errors, including ill-famed techno-disasters.

Coding like `const OuterSpace_Baseline_Kelvin = 2.7` is univocal but inflexible and ugly to the object-oriented eye. As picky pros, we will define trailblazing syntax and features.

NASA part of the software relied on metric data from the "contractor" (the report doesn't name the known company, and neither do I). Still, the latter sent thrust in the _US Customary units_, based on the good old British **Imperial Pound**. Thus the poor
[Mars Climate Orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter)<sup><b>w</b></sup> was put below the "survival altitude" orbit.

### Looks good ... `</ü™ù>`

<b>... to stake out a repository for CV.</b> But it's not a solution

‚ùóThe contractor team of SmallForces knew that the thrust must be communicated in _newtons_. 
They took the hardware reported value (the engineers there traditionally operated in the "house" system) and honestly submitted it as _N_. 

Thus, the first issue would be providing the unit selection's limitations. 

```csharp

public enum In
{
    [Abbr("dyn")]
    dyne,

    [Abbr("N")]
    newton = 1_000_000_000_000,

    [Abbr("lbf")]
    pound_force = 4_448_222_000_000,

    [Abbr("kip")]
    kilopound = 1_000 * pound_force,

    [Abbr("pdl")]
    poundal = 138_254_954_376, // since 1877, Absolute English system
} 
```

And it's only one on the list of ...

## Other cases

## Beyond

### Units are not only measurement systems

### Values are not only numbers

### Beyond a single crystal

Example: Temperature dependency on pressure

```csharp
Pressure(val, In).Temperature(val, In)
```
