> **The best evolutionary paradigm of OOP is directly mapping real-life things or abstractions,  their structures, and collections onto code objects.**

Object-oriented languages offer common paradigms with specific means and techniques to fine-tune or expand them.

Such customization traditionally involves classes and methods, while properties conceal even more potential. Next, we will bundle disparate **`C#`** techniques for _properties shifting_.

```

<p align="right">* <sub>While your job is to define these operators.</sub><br />
** <sub>More techniques can be added later.</sub></p>

Let's keep a _**book**_ as a convenient sample of our survey. It has a title, author(s), ID(s), publishing agent, year and tongue, and other traits. 
If some of them _shift_, as proposed below, then the inheritance approach will break on combinatory explosion.

```mermaid

  direction RL
  class Book {
    title : string
    id: ISBN
    tongues: Tongue[]
    abstract: Media
    status: Status
    ...
  }
  class Person{
    id : int
    name : Name
    birth: Date
    nationality: Country[]
    ...
  }
  class Organization{
    id : int
    name : Name
    location : Location[]
    ...
  }
  Book "1" --o "1-n" Person : authored
  Book "1" --o "1" Organization : published

  style Student fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```

## Generic properties (`<T>`-Properties)

Properties can't be generic like methods, but class generics can specify their _tuned_ type. This can be useful for selecting "fluctuating" model traits.

For example, there are two formats of ISBN or none; the author's birth can be known as an exact date, but for Homer, it's _circa_ 8th century BCE. 

Book authors may have dissimilar name patterns (even the Western can differ). 
An abstract can be some plain text or reference to an audio snippet.

```csharp
partial class Book<TId> Book where TId : ISBN
{
   TId Id;
}
```

## Read-write ragged properties (R/W-Properties)

The first solution will be to have a 

Create new()
   all fields are editable 
Present

Edit
   Summary, status, person info,


Consider that there must be read-only book views

Summary open for edit.

## Assign operator overloading

## Generic parametrization

Modeling generic properties with ragged access

Different ISBN formats or even no ISBN.

And is quite good with this but simple (otherwise it couldn't be a winning paradigm).

It's our job to advance OOD further.

> üöß... DRAFT ... üöß

# C#&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ragged properties (T-RW-Modelling)

In a decent application, a class may represent a document structure.

The business logic may specify miscellaneous access.

## Ideas

INTERFACE ONLY


Most applications need to present the same entity (model) with a different exposure of items and read/write access. Consider developing a book register:

The set of items is quite usual and fixed: Title, ISBN, genre, years written, first-last published, original tongue(s) **(not xlation but some books are already polyglot ...), author(s), abstract, reviews.

* new (you can edit anything - ISBN)


> :exclamation: This is not REPLACEMENT of FIRM interfaces

## Appendix. Realization 

We can't escape making the number of interfaces, which equals the required combinations, but the technique matters.


+ allows easy auto-generation (e.g. with T4)

### Stubbing the interface

The easiest way is to have the "full open" class and cast it to the interface.

DYNAMIC !
