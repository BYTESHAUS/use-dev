 <h1 align="center">OOP and Polymorphism&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>expanded</i></h1>

Two of the four pillars beneath object-oriented programming are plain: <mark>_encapsulation_</mark> and <mark>_inheritance_</mark>, &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; one can't misinterpret these two.

<mark>_Abstraction_</mark> is abstract by definition, but doesn't need much portrayal. It is the essence of thinking and programming: object-oriented or not.

But vague <span title="&nbsp;&thinsp; Greek:&#013;&#010&nbsp;πολύ&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;many&#013;&#010&nbsp;μορφ&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp; form"><ins><mark>&thinsp;**polymorphism**&thinsp;</mark></ins></span> has many forms of "many forms"<sup>☁️</sup>:

+ **subtypes** &mdash; an outcome of inheritance,
+ **parametric** &mdash; as generics in C++, Python, Java, or C#,
+ **name sharing** &mdash; [ad hoc] method overriding/overloading,
+ _others_ &mdash; some of which we want to discuss next:\
