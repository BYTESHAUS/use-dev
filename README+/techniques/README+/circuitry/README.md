# P<samp>atterns via techniques</samp> &rarr; Circuitry

Â«CircuitryÂ» like many other ideas is better presented by _inductive reasoning_ &mdash; namely by an example as below.

Consider a bundle of interlaced "_either_"-functions:

<div align="right"><sub><i>C#-like pseudo-code for brevety</i></sub></div>

```csharp
class Is {
  string _text;

  bool NullOrEmpty => _text is null || ' == _text;
  bool NullOrWhitespace { ... };
  bool Ascii { ... };
  bool Latin { ... };
  bool AlphaNumeric { ... };
}

```

and there's a need for them (functions) as **`neither`**. Since there's no magic out-of-the-hat ðŸª„ _Boolean Inverter_ the most predictable way will be a wrapper over:

```csharp
class Not : Is {
  override NullOrEmpty => !NullOrEmpty;
  override NullOrWhitespace => !NullOrWhitespace;
  override Ascii => !Ascii;
  override Latin => !Latin;
  override AlphaNumeric => !AlphaNumeric;
}

// or Adapter class if methods aren't virtual
```

Other alternatives are discussed in the [Appendix](#alternatives).

But what if instead of a programmatic approach, we implement a declarative markup

CODE SNIPPET!

GOES BEYOND SIMPLE LINEAR

It was CIRCUITRY BUT WHY WAND?


is an EXPERIMENTAL technique

// Illustration pending

It's the case going. Consider a class that 

why not 
constructors, init props, or derived classes?

## Implementations



## Wrap up. Do not abuse

Remember the quote of von Neuman ?
Everything can be presented as digital elements

HAVE YOU NOTICE A TYPO i INTENTIONALLY LEAVED ? I personally don't like such wrappers.
