# P<samp>atterns via Techniques</samp>: Object-oriented Circuitry

> ¬´C<samp>IRCUITRY</samp>¬ª as an idea is better presented by _inductive reasoning_ &mdash; from a case below.

Consider a bundle of interlaced "_either_"-functions:

<div align="right"><sub><i>C#-like pseudo-code for brevity</i></sub></div>

```csharp
class Is {
  string _text;

  bool NullOrEmpty => _text is null || '' == _text;
  bool NullOrWhitespace { ... };
  bool Ascii { ... };
  bool Latin { ... };
  bool AlphaNumeric { ... };
}

```

and there's a demand for them (functions) as **`neither`**. Since there's no magic out-of-the-hat ü™Ñ _Boolean Inverter_ the most predictable way will be a wrapper over:

```csharp
class Not : Is {
  override NullOrEmpty => !NullOrEmpty;
  override NullOrWhitespace => !NullOrWhitespace;
  override Ascii => !Ascii;
  override Latin => !Latin;
  override AlphaNumeric => !AlphaNumeric;
}

// or an Adapter aggregating class when methods aren't virtual
```

It's not a single realization option **but what if** instead of a "programmatic" approach, we offer a kind of 
<samp><mark>declarative markup</mark></samp>.

```csharp

class Is<Fn> : Is where Fn : Function<bool, bool> {
   override NullOrEmpty => Fn(NullOrEmpty);
   ...
}

class Not : Is<Invert>;
class Denier : Is<False>;
class Stub : Is<True>;
class Identity : Is<Wire>; 

```

This simplest _unary boolean_ has four parametrization variants &mdash; other types are much more combinatory and appealing:

+ Bring your own algorithm:\
`"some string".Equals<Loose>(CompareOptions.IgnoreCase);`

+ Lingua\
text.Is<French, Latin>.Alphanumeric;

+ Numbers
Random<ALGORITHM>.Within(1, 100)

+ Objects

## Pros and cons

‚úÖ First of all, the split of design in a good way.

declarative is plus

üõë Overengineering

üóùÔ∏èüï∞Ô∏è implement difficulties 

C# doesn't have `Func` generic constraint to be patched
 (DELETGATE doesn't help)
 
___________

The biggest advantage - you decide the extent


## Wrap up. Do not abuse

"Circuitry" shall patch parts where  This approach may smoothly lead back to machine language.

### Dynamic Majic Wand

You can build your magic wand with dynamic programming (e.g. Roslyn for C#).

```csharp

var notOptions = Invert<Is>();

{
  T Invert<T><S boolie) where S : T;
}


```

#### Cons

Run-time assembled code is worse to debug.

### Wrapper class

### Pros 

### Const

HAVE YOU NOTICE A TYPO i INTENTIONALLY LEAVED ? I personally don't like such wrappers.
