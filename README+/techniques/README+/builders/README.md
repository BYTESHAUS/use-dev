> But we are here not to yammer but to collect techniques and ideas that mitigate the complexities and still render intuitive builders (to some extent).

First of all, creating unlimited context constructors is possible with

+ auto-generating templates under defined scenarios,
+ dynamic code generation to stuff the selected interface.

However, are there products for which it won't be an over-mega-engineering? Let's go to the next:

Meanwhile, some construction techniques are there:\
|- [<b>Code Wizard blocks</b>](../../../../src/TuttiFrutti/WizConstr/README.md)\
|- [AbcChrono](../../../parts/AbcChrono)\
|- [ISie extensions](../../../parts/_ext/ISie/README.md)

The following topics contemplate object building:\
|- [Circuitry](../circuitry)

## Conclusion

Nevertheless, the best technique when hit against the wall is to cut constructors and make other bulky but easy initializations.
