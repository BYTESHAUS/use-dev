# T<samp>echniques</samp> &mdash; Builders (hard trail)

Generics are at the pinnacle of C# technical embarrassment, but <ins>&thinsp;<samp><b>builders</b></samp>&thinsp;</ins> is a notional <b>dead-end</b> in this "sharp" and less strongly-typed object-oriented languages.

Here we are not to yammer but to collect techniques and ideas that mitigate the complexities and still render intuitive builders (to some extent).

First of all, creating unlimited context constructors is possible with

+ auto-generating templates under defined scenarios,
+ dynamic code generation to stuff the selected interface.

However, are there products for which it won't be an over-mega-engineering? Let's go to the next:

## Conclusion

Nevertheless (if you hit the wall) the best technique is to cut contructors and fill out with other initializations.
