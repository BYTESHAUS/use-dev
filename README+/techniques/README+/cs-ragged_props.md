# C#&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ragged properties (T-RW-Modelling)

What does the title mean except calembour (Clay folder and Models LINK!)? Let me begin with an example

Example - a counterpart of abstraction, is a grand teacher of everything, within normal rationality.

Example 

Let's learn by example, implemented in Models.

## Ideas

INTERFACE ONLY


Most applications need to present the same entity (model) with a different exposure: of items and read/write access. Consider developing a book register:

The set of items is quite usual and fixed: Title, ISBN, genre, years written, first-last published, original tongue(s) **(not xlation but some books are already polyglot ...), author(s), abstract, reviews.

* new (you can edit anything - ISBN)


> :exclamation: This is not REPLACEMENT of FIRM interfaces

## Realization

We can't escape making the number of interfaces, which equals the required combinations, but the technique matters.


+ allows easy auto-generation (e.g. with T4)

### Stubbing the interface

The easiest way is to have the "full open" class and cast it to the interface.


DYNAMIC !
