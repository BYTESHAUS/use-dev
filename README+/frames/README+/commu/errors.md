## Limitations

### `Not Implemented` / `Not Supported` / `Invalid Operation` are not "true" exceptions and not for clients

There are languages native<sup>🌩️</sup> and customs exceptions/errors, which programs can raise to tell that a method/feature/module is under development, delayed or its call/parameters are deprived of sense (under certain conditions):

<sup>🌩️</sup>&nbsp;
[`NotImplementedError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html) in Python,
 [`UnsupportedOperation`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/UnsupportedOperationException.html) in Java or
 [`NotImplemented`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.notimplementedexception), [`NotSupported`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.notsupportedexception), and
 [`InvalidOperation`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.invalidoperationexception) in C#.

They can "**stub**" calls or serve as bookmarks for work-in-progress, and other developers will accept them as a replacement for crude `//ToDo`_s_ or as an excuse for logic incompleteness/coding litter.

<p>What's decent for developers is not for releases:</p> 
<ul>
 <li>Users get fake UI actions enabled.</li>
 <li>Actions pop ugly error message boxes (the last thing after a crash, users love to see).</li>
 <li>APIs and services provide ghost methods. (What's worse, they may fail silently.) </li>
 <li>Requests that just worked with these or those parameters fail with others.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr></table>

#### Alternatives

* Disable or, if UI, provide an explanation message (though also not great).
* Design a return value that envisages errors.
* In conditional cases: raise a sort of _Argument Exception_.
* **Most exotic**: implement.
