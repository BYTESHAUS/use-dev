 You may find the folklore right above dull but not pointless. Math relies on pure numbers, computers operate on pure digits but not developers and users.  
 
 The inputs and outputs of applications anchor to the material world, where even named values may be ambiguous: 

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;<ins>A child's age of `7` can be months or years</ins>&nbsp;<b>. . .</b></summary>
            
- An altitude on EU domestic flights is measured in feet while variometers may show metres.
- Temperature of `36.6` looks native in _Kelvin_ for liquid gases and in _Celsius_ - for medicine.
- A close approach to Mars equals `33'900'000` miles but seems credible in kilometers and nmi.
- `Jack` can be family, given (not only on birth), and branded name.
- `$1'000` or `1'000‚Ç¨` has temporal purchase ability, different for essential goods, 1GB of DRAM, and gold ounce

</details>

_Concrecte values_ in applications may rely on context or imply a single system of categorization (e.g. SI for physical values) and ... open wide the gate to errors, including ill-famed techno-disasters. (So obvious that doesn't need explanation.)

 Old fashion like `const Temperature_AbsZero_Kelvin = 0.00` makes values univocal but ugly to the object-oriented eye.
 
 As a good developer, you will come to a better view, like `Heating.Max[Celcius] = 82.15` or `Landing.Speed.Knots` vs `.KmPerHour`. Then you will think about ways of initialization, conversion functions, math ops, constants, and other headaches. 

 And here you are, where such a framework is available for use, alteration, or just as a concept.

## Features and omissions

## Overload of math ops

Looks first absolutely natural and a must.

``` var sum = Length.Meter(1) + Length.Centimeter(2)```

This [shabby meme](https://github.com/Kyriosity/read-write/blob/main/readme%2B/pencraft/readme%2B/_rsc/_img/memes/CalmDown_0Cplus0Cis64F.jpg) must remind the obstacle. 
 
You must already know the right conclusion: only for common-zero factored units.
