# C# - Design decisions

Design decisions bridge the theory of architecture and working solutions in practiced languages and technologies. On the lower level, they are backed up with [C# hints](https://github.com/Kyriosity/read-write/blob/main/README%2B/.net/README%2B/cs-hints.md) and [techniques](https://github.com/Kyriosity/read-write/blob/main/README%2B/.net/README%2B/cs-techniques.md).

Albeit .NET they can be realized in other general-purpose high-level languages, even ALGOL.
