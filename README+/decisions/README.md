# Design decisions

Design decisions bridge design and working solutions in practiced languages and technologies. They are strengthened with [frames and rules](../frames) and glued with [praxis hints](https://github.com/Kyriosity/read-write/blob/main/README%2B/.net/README%2B/cs-hints.md).

Albeit .NET inclined, they can be followed in other general-purpose high-level languages, even ALGOL. (That was the intention.)
