# Testing - Gradual assert

Despite languages and frameworks, we are used to peremptory feedback from tests: ✅&nbsp;XOR&nbsp;❌ (either **success** or **fail**). 

The same for their change. Code works and not.

This is absolutely JUST-D for many if not most cases, but there are other stories with vague and changeable criters:

- Precision of functions.
- Execution time and other resource consumption.
- Strength of encryption

The same applies to negative results. "Not great and not terrible"

Why to worry about?
