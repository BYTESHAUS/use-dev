This section branches from conceptual discussions of [Tests](https://github.com/Kyriosity/read-write/tree/main/README+/software/tests), and [Quality Assurance](https://github.com/Kyriosity/read-write/tree/main/README+/software/QA) and proposes realistic decisions for programmatic tests and their automation.
