# Test automation &mdash; Unit tests with multi-feed

The usual approach to unit tests is to take a piece of functionality and write a proof routine over it.

Just take an entity (unit) of an application as a `class` or `function` and cover it with proofs.

```mermaid
graph TD
    Arguments -->|One| UT[Arange/Act/Assert]
    Functions -->|Two| UT
    Services -->|Two| UT
```

This approach is OVER and clutches testing projects with space with UNPACKED.

```csharp
[Test, SOURCE(A, B2, C30, D04, ...)]
MeaninglessMethodName()
{
    var result = FACTORY.FuncOfTest(Arrange());
    ASSERT(result); // fail or success
}
```

An [example test](../../../src/TuttiFrutti/FuncStore.Convert.Tests/PhysMath/Dims/LengthsTests.cs) with two feeds

* ?? accumulated warnings/errors/info (e.g. unparsed)
