## Distinguishing the _expected_ error

If an error isn't

IDEAS: 
+ OWN EXCEPTION STACK (though not much recommended by )

COINCIDENCE ... the same exception but ...

Null as an example.

### Separating framework and subject errors and bugs

The subject of the tests may contain errors and throw exceptions &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; **expected** or not. The same for test framework (testbed and fixtures): intentional or not.

That's why test frameworks deserve a special focus on quality, and it's obvious to 

+ define specific exceptions for frameworks (like in [NUnit extensions](../../../src/TuttiFrutti/AbcExtNUnit/Exceptions) here),
+ separate unexpected error conditions from the subject (e.g., examining the call stack).


<h1 align="right">Syntax</h1>

## Valid syntax but wrong logic

> Debunking "silent" logical errors that don't affect success paths is **much more important** than the discovery of explicit errors (<s>users</s> testers will do &mdash; sorry for a dense gag).

### <a id="non-comp-calls">Excluding wrong calls

Most language paradigms (such as casting, access modifiers, and inheritance) and constructs won't allow sophisms (valid code that will throw run-time syntax errors). 

However, custom chain calls and builders are prone to exposing repeating or illogical members. The next _NUnit_ call will compile and run but throw the exception:\
&nbsp; &nbsp; <code>Assert.That(1, Is.EqualTo(1).<mark>Within</mark>(1).<mark>Within</mark>(1).<mark>Percent</mark>.<mark>Ulps</mark>)</code>

Consider a contribution to NUnit to prevent such statements.<sup>ðŸ™‹</sup> Which tests will we attach to the commit?

The only option is to write and comment out statements made non-compatible and comment to uncomment them before a release to ensure they are still invalid (and then comment out again). Preprocessor `#if` directives may help a bit.

Cumbersome?

> A better solution will be a non-trivial metaphysical challenge.

&nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>ðŸ™‹</sup> <sub>That will be another story how many test projects won't build and how many tests (after syntax fix) will fail - those `Expect.Throw<Exception>`.</sub>

**P.S. Tip:** `// // real comment` will allow quick manual tests: _Select&nbsp;All_, _Uncomment_, and _Undo_ (<kbd>Ctrl+A</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl+K+U</kbd>, and <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd> in Visual Studio).
