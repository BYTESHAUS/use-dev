# Tests &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; Loose Asserts

### We are accustomed to thinking of proofs in categorical ("black-and-white") conditions, which a subject either meets<sup>✔️</sup> or misses<sup>❌</sup>. 

That's nothing wrong with this _truth telling_ in most test cases: <b>`5x5`</b> must be **25** (not `25.001`), a <samp>password</samp> must exactly match to alphabet, added glyphs, and case in every char, or an element must be either **visible** or not &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; but challgenges of this truth telling postulate.

Let's take a sports break to compare and illustrate:

+ 🏀 A point (two or three) is added when the standard basketball "equator" crosses the hoop from above - it's a usual test case.
+ 🎯 The picture of an archery target must suggest the deviation:

</td><td>

To make things looser, there could be different bows, distances, and even winds and illumination in open-air tournaments are a factor.
