# <samp>Tests</samp> &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; Loosing the `Asserts`

### We are accustomed to thinking of proofs in categorical conditions, which a subject either meets<sup>✔️</sup> or misses<sup>❌</sup>. 

This _truth telling_ is mostly based: 

* <b>`5x5`</b> will be **25** (not `25.000'001`),
* the longest <kbd>password</kbd> must exactly match to alphabet, SPAN _diactrics_, and upper/lower in every char, CAOTCHA
* a UI element can be either **visible** or not RAZLICHINYI POP

&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; but enough life scenarios will defy the "black-and-white" postulate.

Let's take a sports break to compare and SPARK the imagination:

&nbsp; 🏀 One point (2 or 3) is added when the basketball's "equator" crosses the hoop (from above) &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; a definite `true` or `false`.\

&nbsp; 🎯 the picture of an archery target alone must LOOSEN such evaluation:

</td><td>

### Except for the _golden 10_<sup>✔️</sup> and _out_<sup>❌</sup>, everything else is relative.

To make things more tangled, there could be different bows, distances, and even winds and illumination in open-air tournaments, impacting the result. Besides precision, there's [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision).

The designated issues can now branch and take forms in

+ [**Graduality**](tests-gradual_assert.md)
+ [**Tolerance**](tests-value_tolerance.md)
+ _something else coming later_
