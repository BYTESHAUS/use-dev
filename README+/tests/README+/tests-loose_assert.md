# Tests &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; Loose Asserts

### We are accustomed to thinking of proofs in categorical conditions, which a subject either meets<sup>✔️</sup> or misses<sup>❌</sup>. 

That's nothing wicked in this _truth telling_ in most test cases &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; <b>`5x5`</b> must be **25** (not `25.001`), a <samp>password</samp> must exactly match to alphabet, _diactrics_, and case in every char, or an element must be either **visible** or not &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; but challenges that rend the "black-and-white" postulate.

Let's take a sports break to compare and illustrate:

&nbsp; &nbsp; 🏀 One point (2 or 3) is added when the basketball's "equator" crosses the hoop from above &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; a definite `true` or `false`.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; 🎯 The picture of an archery target must loosen such evaluation:

</td><td>

### Except for the _golden 10_<sup>✔️</sup> and _out_<sup>❌</sup>, everything else is relative.

To make things more tangled, there could be different bows, distances, and even winds and illumination in open-air tournaments, impacting the result. Besides precision, there's [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision).
