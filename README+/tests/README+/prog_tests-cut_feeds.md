## DRY it

"Multidimensional" combinations will
make a mess of tests mass and  deteriorate its quality: negligence, scrappy coverage, impeded navigation, and badly exorbitant maintenance.

we may live with this, since tests are not the product, .

or apply **D**_on't_ **R**_epeat_ **Y**_ourself_ (aka <mark><b>DRY</b></mark>) to our tests ...

Most frameworks will support one-dimensional scaling.

### Parametrization

```csharp
[Test, SOURCE(A, B2, C30, D04, ...)]
MeaninglessMethodName()
{
    var result = FACTORY.FuncOfTest(Arrange());
    ASSERT(result); // fail or success
}
```

routine for a particular run. Let's illustrate with a primitive:\
`Asserts: Root.Square(4) == 2`

The next step is to supply various data and expectations - something that a ripe framework will provide out of the box:\
`DataRows[]`\
or you may 


// Many frameworks support keywords for the data combinations

MULTI-FUNC and VARIOUS TYPES

Just take an entity (unit) of an application as a `class` or `function` and cover it with proofs.

## Wrap up

Was it all about unit tests? Yes, but can work for others in the pyramid.
