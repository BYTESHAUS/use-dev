# `Programmatic Tests` &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; Syntax

Testing writings must meet tougher requirements than the code they prove: 🅰️ be more readable (since they provide entry to the logic and shall be readable for readers ) and **B** be really compact (test coverage is SURPLUS by nature).

The number of test frameworks is big and growing. I can't speak for all but the syntax of many orients to [DAMP](https://github.com/BYTESHAUS/read-write/blob/main/README+/software/tests/asQA/README+/tests-damp_vs_dry.md)).

AAA - pretty immature

NAMES of METHODS!

Shorter syntax speaks for itself


### Assertive fillers

There are apparent items to estimate:

+ bulky and restrained syntax (and it's not [DAMP](https://github.com/BYTESHAUS/read-write/blob/main/README+/software/tests/asQA/README+/tests-damp_vs_dry.md)),
+ pending bugs,
+ missing calls and features.

testing invalid calls

must be more elaborate
