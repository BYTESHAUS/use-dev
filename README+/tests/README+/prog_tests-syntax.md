NUnit is a conventional, reliable, and universal test framework, but like most FOSS, it has limited resources, and its contributors aren't obliged to any delivery.

+ bulky and restrained syntax (and it's not [DAMP](https://github.com/Kyriosity/read-write/blob/main/README+/software/tests/asQA/README+/tests-damp_vs_dry.md)),
+ pending bugs,
+ missing calls and features.
