# Unit tests - Gradual assert

Despite plenty of programming languages and frameworks with our preferences, we are used to categorical feedback from tests: either **success** or **fail**, 🟢 or 🔴 without shades. 

This is entirely normal for many if not most cases, but there are other stories with vague and changeable criteria:

- Precision of calculations. LINK!!! FUNCWARE
- Performance (execution time and other resource consumption).
- Strength of encryption


The same applies to negative results. "Not great and not terrible".

## Problem

grand frameworks don't support any shades of green and red.

### Workaround

Create own
