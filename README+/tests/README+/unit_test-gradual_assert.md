# Unit tests - Gradual assert

Despite plenty of programming languages and frameworks with our preferences, we are used to categorical feedback from tests: either 🟢**success** or 🔴**fail**. 

"Classical" tests don't ask for more but there are other stories with vague and changeable criteria:

- Precision of calculations/deviations
- Performance (execution time and other resource consumption).
- Strength of encryption

The same applies to negative results. "Not great and not terrible".

## Problem

Public test frameworks, as far as I know them, don't support shades of green and red.

### Workaround

Create own

[Funcware tests](../../../src/TuttiFrutti/Funcstore.Convert.Tests/)

Variable criteria.
