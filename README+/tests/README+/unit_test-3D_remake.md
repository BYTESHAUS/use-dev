# Unit tests - "3D" re-make

Developers, testers and management comprehend unit tests as essential and integral as the idea, and uncomplicated and routine as implementation. 
Just take an entity (unit) of an application and cover it with proof.

```csharp
[Test, SOURCE(A, B2, C30, D04, ...)]
MeaninglessMethodName()
{
    var result = FACTORY.FuncOfTest(Arrange());
    ASSERT(result); // fail or success
}
```

Not only value but % is relative.

Let's put 3D glasses on 
3D exploded view

+ win-win: data <-> test
* ?? false true (by coincidental match)
* ?? accumulated warnings/errors/info (e.g. unparsed)
