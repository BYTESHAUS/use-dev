# Testing - Gradual assert

Despite languages and frameworks, we are used to peremptory feedback from tests: ✅&nbsp;XOR&nbsp;❌ (either **success** or **fail**). 

The same for their change. Code works and not.

This is absolutely JUST-D for many if not most cases, but there are other stories with vague and changeable criters:

- Precision of calculations. LINK!!! FUNCWARE
- Performance (execution time and other resource consumption).
- Strength of encryption

The same applies to negative results. "Not great and not terrible"

## Problem

grand frameworks don't support any shades of grren and red.

### Workaround

Create own
