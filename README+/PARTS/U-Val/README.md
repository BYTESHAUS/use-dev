 You may find the folklore right above dull but not pointless. Math relies on pure numbers, computers operate on pure digits but not developers and users.  
 
 The inputs and outputs of applications anchor to the material world, where even named values are meaningless without unit, category, or benchmark. 

- A child's age of `7` can be months and years.
- Temperature of `36.6` looks native in _Kelvin_ for liquid gases and in _Celsius_ - for medicine.
- Close approach to Mars as `33'900'000` seems credible in miles and kilometers.
- `Jack` can be family, given (not only on birth), and branded name.
- `$1'000` or `1'000‚Ç¨` has temporal purchase ability, different for essential goods, 1GB of DRAM, and gold ounce

Values in applications may rely on context or imply a single system of categorization (e.g. SI for physical values) and ... open wide the gate to errors, including ill-famed techno-disasters. (So obvious that doesn't need explanation.)

 Old fashion like `const Temperature_AbsZero_Kelvin = 0.00` makes values univocal but ugly to the object-oriented eye, and as a good developer, you will guess a better view: `Heating.Max.[Celcius] = 82.15`

## Features and omissions

## Overload of math ops

Looks first absolutely natural and a must.

``` var sum = Length.Meter(1) + Length.Centimeter(2)```

This [shabby meme](https://github.com/Kyriosity/read-write/blob/main/readme%2B/pencraft/readme%2B/_rsc/_img/memes/CalmDown_0Cplus0Cis64F.jpg) must remind the obstacle. 
 
You must already know the right conclusion: only for common-zero factored units.
