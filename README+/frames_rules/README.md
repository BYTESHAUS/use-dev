    <p>Then design can be <mark>formworks</mark> of the concrete.</p>

The space between architectural/design decisions and implementation unties programming hands to code a feature in multiple variations (the same as a tongue can describe the same thing in different forms and ways). 

Let alone syntax preferences, which selection begins from the very first letter: capitalize, underscore, or not.

This stimulates creativity, competitiveness, and the search for better syntax, but on a large scale the bigger the assortment, the greater the disorder. 
Thus any big team or project gradually establishes certain frames and rules of coding, which shall not be dogmatic and, sure, can't be 100% applied (noticeable if over 1/2).

So, welcome to consider my modest contribution of [frames, guidelines, and rules](README+)⬇️.
