# Chronology - timelines - events

Time is the _driver_ for all and the "solvent" of everything. The former is for software and the latter for its hardware.

It silently stands by throughout software applications (even databases are just thick timestamps) but gets insufficient attention from languages and frameworks. 
Software of the previous millennium gave literally bits for dates, thus nurturing the giant Y2K bug.
