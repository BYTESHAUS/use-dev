# Chronology - timelines - events

Time is the driver of all and the solutent for everything. The former is for software and the later for its hardware.

It silently presents throughout software applications (even databases are just fat timestamps), but gets little attention from languages and frameworks.

Software of the previous **millenium** gave literally bits for dates, thus nurtiring the giant Y2K bug.
