# Chronology - Timelines - Events

Time is the _driver_ for all and the "solvent" of everything. The former is for software and the latter for its hardware.

Exact time measurement<sup>ðŸ”¬</sup> and timestamping aren't an issue for regular solutions but chronology.

Software of the previous millennium gave bits for dates (and bits means literally bits), thus nurturing the giant Y2K bug. Contemporary languages can support a vast range of past and future dates<sup>ðŸ“†</sup>, but badly organize them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>ðŸ”¬</sup> <sub>Unless you need accuracy close to [physics on steroids](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2023/summary/).<sup>ðŸ”—</sup></sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>ðŸ“†</sup> <sub>Astonishly surrending to Java  C# `DateTime`supports only Common Era. Though there are [Calendar](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.calendar)<sup>ðŸ”—</sup> classes to limited rescue.</sub>

## Framework - Theses

### Initial requirements

+ Definition of timescales: eras, epochs, or calendars
+ Intuitive syntax rooting from Era/Epoch/Calendar specification
+ Approximation to specify events known as _circa_
+ Guards: range limit (e.g. 1-28/29/30/31 for months) compile- and run-time ()

### Next - Features and demands 

+ Fuzzy comparisson
+ Glossary 
+ Casting
+ More chronologies

### The crown - Integration with U-Val

## C# solution 

Disclaimer! Version&nbsp;**1** this is a functional sketch. A foundation to try and release all-around solution. 

### Remarks 


### Alternatives

One-page (single-class) wizard.

Wizard VM over model with masking.

### Implementation blog

#### Layout 

basic simplified logic and syntax over it. TDD tests to prove and demo.

#### Shortcuts for eras with masks

interfaces to mask methods

3) Parametrize with INumber 
4) Timeline Model
5) Guards
6)
