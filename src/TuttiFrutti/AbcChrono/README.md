# Chronology - Timelines - Events

Time is the _driver_ for all and the "solvent" of everything. The former is for software and the latter for its hardware.

Exact time measurement<sup>ðŸ”¬</sup> and timestamping aren't an issue for casual solutions but chronology. Software of the previous millennium gave literally bits for dates, thus nurturing the giant Y2K bug. Contemporary languages can support a vast range of past and future dates<sup>ðŸ“†</sup>, but badly organize them.
