# TestsðŸ§ª *featuring* ... testsðŸ§ª

This project presents _prÃªt-Ã -porter_ testing goodies already running in test/demo projects of this solution (Tutti Frutti).

**You are welcome to use them as well.**

<h2 align="center">Attribute shortcuts</h2>

<samp><b>RECOMMENDED:</b><samp> It doesn't introduce new functionality but cleanses existing NUnit calls/references off formalities peel.

-> [Try without further ado](Shortcuts)

<h2 align="center">Variable-like data sources</h2>

NUnit provides dynamic data sources but in quite a surplus fashion, and requiring much Repeat Yourself.

Automatic discovery of datasource

And look hot they are already running in ...

It's better once to try and see how it runs in available test projects

LINK REQUIRED !

INFO: this is a feature opened for extension

SIMILAR APPROACH IS USED in FUNCWARE.

<h2 align="center">Assert-by-assign <a id="assert-by-assign" /></h2>

The intention was not only to shorten syntax but to release the subject of the test from the parentheses (to emphasize).

```csharp
True = yourObject.AnyTruthValuingFunction();
Eq[1968] = CE.YearOf("Algol68");
Within[3.14, 3.15] = CustomPiCalculation();
Error = DivideByZero => MyMath.DivideBy(0.00);
```
-> [More demos](AssertByAssign)

> [!WARNING]
> <samp>EXPERIMENTAL</samp> syntax on questionable premises.
> 
> It's not a replacement of NUnit but some sugar for rapid prototyping and demos.
