Reflexion on Undo/Redo sooner or later will baffle one with the following dilemmas and challenges. Neither is a dev task nor a knowledge quiz but does purify the "big picture".

Chess is a perfect example where the sequence of changes can be stored either as moves (actions) or board alteration (value). A move results in a board alteration.

Following considerations and their solutions do not belong to the _Reversible_.
