# Unit test - exploded-view 3D vision

The usual view of unit tests is plain:

```csharp
[Test]
Method()
{
    Assert(something);
}
```

Not only value but % is relative.

3D exploded view

+ win-win: data <-> test
* ?? false true (by coincidental match)
* ?? accumulated warnings/errors/info (e.g. unparsed)
