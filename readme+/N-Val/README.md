# Multifaceted Value

Alias: _**N-Val**_ :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:

---
<div dir="rtl">?Gauges&nbsp;-</dir>
<div dir="rtl">!300&nbsp;-</div>
<div dir="rtl">?What 300&nbsp;-</div>
<div dir="rtl">?What gaugess&nbsp;-</div>
&nbsp;

You may find the folklore right above dull but not pointless. Math relies on pure numbers, and computers operate with them. However **and** chiefly, for devs **and** users, the inputs **and** outputs of software abstractions anchor to the material world.

And in this world, even named values are devoid of meaning unless defined in units and names. Age of ´7´ can be months or years, name `Smith` can be given or surname and also TRADEMARK. A temperature of  `36.6` can be Celsius a normal body temperature in Celsius 


## So what's the problem

OOP solves naming but not UNITs/GRADEs.
CONTEXT is an open door for catastrophes. Should i recall CHANGE of SYS, misinterptitation.

## Beyond the first sketch

Unions of values as square\
Value vs presentation\
Math optimization (function chaining, straightening camel calcs, accumulating inaccuracy, caching, unmanaged code, tree search)\
Differing types beyond a value

### PHYSICAL VALUES ARE A SEPARATE BIG SUB-DOMAIN

Unit systems

### NOT ONLY PHYSICAL VALUES (UValues) 

Currency exchange

### NOT ONLY NUMBERS (
