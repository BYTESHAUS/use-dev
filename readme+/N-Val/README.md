# Multifaceted Value

Alias: _**N-Val**_ :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:

---
<div dir="rtl">!Gauges?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;300&nbsp;-</dir>
<div dir="rtl">?What 300?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;What gauges&nbsp;-</dir>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

You may find the folklore right above dull but not pointless. Math relies on pure numbers, and computers operate with them. However **and** chiefly, for devs **and** users, the inputs **and** outputs of software abstractions anchor to the material world.

And in this world, even named values are devoid of meaning unless categorized. _Age_ of `7` can be months and years, `Smith` can be given, surname and trademark. A surface temperature of  `36.6` is natural if Celsius for humans and Kelvin for the dark side of Neptune. Close approach to Mars of 33.900.000 may sound both in miles and kilometers.

## So what's the problem?

The object-oriented design fits well with custom categorization but no programming language has pre-programmed structures, especially for physical units. 

 Thus applications 

 - rely on context (way of disasters),
 - imply a single system of categorization, e.g. SI for physical values (quite limited even within a single culture and location),
 - use COBOL-style naming like `const absZeroKelvin = 0`,
 - implement its own solution (which re-invents the whee).
