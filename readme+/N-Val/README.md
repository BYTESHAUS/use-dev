You may find the folklore right above dull but not pointless. Math relies on pure numbers, computers operate on pure digits, but not developers and users. The inputs **and** outputs of software abstractions sooner or later anchor to the material world and therein even named values remain meaningless unless categorized in units. 

* Child's _age_ of `7` can be months and years, `Smith` can be given, surname and trademark.
* A temperature of `36.6` may speak of humans in _Celsius_ and about superconductivity in _Kelvin_.
* Close approach to Mars as 33.900.000 sounds credible both in miles and kilometers<sup>:rocket:</sup>.

## What's the challenge?

The object-oriented design fits fine with custom categorization but no popular programming language pre-determines standards and definitions, particularly for physical units. 

Thus applications 

 - rely on context (and open door for disastrous scenarios),
 - imply a single system of categorization, e.g. SI for physical values (rather limited even within a single culture and location, or enterprise),
 - style procedural like `const absZero_Kelvin = 0` is unambiguous but ugly to the object-oriented sight,
 - implement a tailored solution.

## Answer to the problem

Just a shared one based on the experience of those tailored.

```csharp
var heating = Temperature.Celsius(27.6);
var spaceZero = Temperature.Kelvin<double>(2.725);
var stationAmbient = Temperature.Celsius(20);
var diffENTROPY = NASA.CALC_ENTROPY(soundEuroAustronaut.Fahrenheit - spaceZero);

```

## Is multifaceted the right word?

Is the term and project not too pretentious, while it's a straightforward conversion?

## Beyond the first sketch

Unions of values as square\
Value vs. presentation\
Math optimization (function chaining, straightening camel calculations (incl. intermediate overflow), accumulating inaccuracy, caching, unmanaged code, tree search)\
Differing types beyond a value
